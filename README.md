# Cup

A Java servlet that is currently only compatible with the [Saucer HTTP server](https://github.com/lottetreg/saucer). Use Cup to create apps that run on Saucer.

The [Matcha web framework](https://github.com/lottetreg/matcha) is a Cup app!

For those from the Ruby world: Cup is to Rack as Matcha is to Rails.
